ofxQualcommAR: Qualcomm Augmented Reality Openframeworks addon
---------------------------------------------------------------

[Openframeworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) addon to use the [Qualcomm AR](http://developer.qualcomm.com/dev/augmented-reality) SDK by [Roger Pal√†](http://rogerpala.com).

This addon is meant to be an easy way to take advantage of the powerful QualcommAR SDK to be able to have advanced Augmented Reality in the iPhone using openframeworks. 

With ofxQualcommAR you can use FrameMarkers (Ar markers around a Frame, that allows you to insert custom content inside) and ImageTargets (really accurate image tracking).


###Requirements

* Openframeworks v0062 or v007
* Mac OSX with xcode.
* iPhone


###Samples

There is an addon and different examples for openframeworks v0062 and v007.

You can find the example targets to print in the assets folder.

As it is using the iPhone camera this addon won't run on the iPhone simulator.
